HandleBar Burgers project - an app leveraging the express and HandleBars frameworks.

##Project Description:
HandleBars Burger App - an app leveraging HandleBars and express frameworks with SQL.
'HandleBars Burger app' allows a user to track the burgers they would like to eat as well as the burgers they have eaten.

Burgers are stored in MySQL, accessible through express and displayed using Handlebars.

##Purpose of this project: 
HandleBars Burger challenges the programmer to utilize HandleBars and express.js frameworks. Additionally, the programmer is challenged to maniputlate objects/records in the DB via the front end interactions. Handle Bars allows for the user to leverage a consistent look for all views of a website, however we did not utilize this functionality - it will be important to exercise this ability with multiple partials or views.

##How to get started:
1. You'll need 'Node.js' and 'npm' installed on your machine
2. In the folder where the 'friend-finder' repo is located, run 'npm i' in your terminal to install the following required packages:
    a. express
    b. mysql2
    c. express-handlebars

With all those steps complete, you should be ready to run the 'HandleBar Burger App'!

##Where you can find help:
If you are stuck with this project, it is useful to utilize Google whenever you are unsure - 
    a. express routing
    b. Bootstrap Documentation
    c. jQuery POST
    d. HandleBars Brackets meaning

Many of these Google searches will return useful code from Stackoverflow that may be useful too - what others used to implement the queries and ingest the data.
